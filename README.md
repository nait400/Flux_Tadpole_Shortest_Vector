# Flux_Tadpole_Shortest_Vector

This repository is intended to be an open source project where anyone interested in string theory research can get their hands dirty. The project began following the work done in, [arxiv:Number](arxivlink) "On Fluxes in the $1^9$ Landau-Ginzburg Model" by Katrin Becker, Nathan Brady, and Anindya Sengupta. Original versions of the provided code are currently in Mathematica notebooks, however, all of the computations involved are translatable (if a little tedious) to lower-level languages *e.g. Python, C, C++, FORTRAN, etc.* Anyone interested in contributing to this project are more than welcome to contact us!
